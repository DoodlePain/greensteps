# Requirements

## Milestone 1 (Minimum Viable Product)
- I sign in. I have a profile.
- I enter how many bags I picked up and how many miles I walked.
- There is a point system that meets the following requirements
  - Each bag is worth four points and every mile walked is worth one point.
  - Once I get 10 points, the app will then ask me if I want to redeem my
  points now for a small prize or accumulate my points to 20 or 30 points for a
  larger prize.
  - Once I redeem my points (either for 10, 20, or 30), my app shows me a
  list of prizes I can pick from.
  - When a user picks a prize an admin is notified that they need to send it
  out
  - After a participant redeems their 10 or 30 points, their points are
  reset.

## Milestone 2
- Once I enter my bags and miles, the app will open my camera and ask me to take
a picture of the bags before I throw them away (for accountability).
- If I pick a prize that is on the list, I will then be able to use a QR code on
my phone to redeem that prize immediately (insta-gift?). Emails to admins can be
stopped once this is implemented.

## Milestone 3

a business where I would like to use my points at (if I use the suggestion box,
a message will pop up saying I will get notification of my approved request).
