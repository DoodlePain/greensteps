# Greensteps Web App

## Welcome
Hi there! We are just getting started with this project. The goal is to have a
minimum viable product (MVP) by December 2017. For more details on what we're
planning to have in the MVP, checkout the [project
requirements](REQUIREMENTS.md).

We'd love your help with developing this app! See the [contribution
guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

## Explore the App
A sample version of the app is hosted at
https://greensteps-staging.herokuapp.com/. Feel free to explore and play around
with it. If you find something that doesn't seem quite right be sure to [open an
issue](https://github.com/crawfoal/greensteps/issues/new)!

## Contributing
We'd love for you to contribute to our project! First, please read our
[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of
Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Also, please keep in mind that our current focus is on developing a minimum
viable product. Pull requests that are focused on this will be prioritized.
Thank you (in advance :slightly_smiling_face:) for understanding!
